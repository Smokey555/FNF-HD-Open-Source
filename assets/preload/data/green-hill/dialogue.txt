:sonic:default:You were in the way of my daily lap around Green Hill.
:sonic:default:I tried stopping before I ran into you, but I guess my momentum still carried for a bit.

:effect:rightSide:
:bf:happy:It's all I've been doing for the past few months. Just bein' on the grind y'know?

:sonic:default:Aw yeah! I love rap, I jam out to it constantly! I also do a little bit of free styling when I'm bored.

:effect:rightSide:
:bf:fist:Yee yee, I've seen you emcee in some commercials before! I wanna see if it was all bluff.

:sonic:confused:Commercials? That probably wasn't me, I hate public speaking and all that stuff!
:sonic:default:If you're tryna rap though, then let's chill and jam out! I've got nothin' but time.
